# HelloWorld

## Overview
This project contains a simple "Hello World" project for both Python and C++. I also wanted to make sure I had development for C++ projects set up correctly in Visual Studio Code.

To run the C++ file in VS Code, the project folder must be opened using Developer Command Prompt for VS.
